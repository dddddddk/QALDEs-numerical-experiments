The codes for the numerical experiments in "[An improved quantum algorithm for linear autonomous differential equations via Pad√© approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06948)".

Experiments 1, 2, and 4 can run directly. 

Running experiment 3 is time comsuming. We provide the results of Experiment 3 in '[./data/](./data/)'. To get the resulting figure of experiment 3, one can run [read_and_plot_exp3.m](./read_and_plot_exp3.m).
